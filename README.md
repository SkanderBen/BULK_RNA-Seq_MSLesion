# BULK_RNA-Seq_MS_Lesion

Bulk analysis of MS lesions(Supervised & Unsupervised)

This is an analysis performed on the bulk RNA-Seq dataset

The workflow (Supervised) is as follows:

	1-Inspect variance in the dataset (Filtering, Normalization, PCA)
	2-Perform differential expression analysis (Using limma)
	3-Annotate biological signatures found by DEA (GSEA)
